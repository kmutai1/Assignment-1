CS105: Introduction to Computer Science (Lab 1)

Due date: September 9, Midnight | submissions would be accepted through GitHub only unless stated otherwise. 

Lab 1 is divided into two parts. The first part requires you to modify the function named power_using_iteration(base, exp) placed inside iteration.py while the second part requires you to modify the function named power_using_recursion(base, exp) placed inside recursion.py.

The specific tasks that you have to complete are stated below: 

(1) Set up a local repository on your computer (or lab machine) on PyCharm (see how at https://bit.ly/2ZypGeY) 

(2) Read the code and comments provided in both of the files (iteration.py and recursion.py), and comments carefully, and run each file one by one to see if the code works as intended and gives the correct outputs for the given input. 

(3) You may have already noticed that both of the functions work only for the following scenarios (Conditions). The parameter named base is supposed to be a number (integer or float), while the exponent (variable name exp) is expected to be a positive integer. In other words, the function would not return the correct output if the exponent is not a positive integer. (Test this limitation by supplying negative integer or float to both of the functions)

(4) Now your task is to make modifications such that both of the functions return correct output for any integer-valued exponent i.e. positive and negative integers, and zero.   

(5) Test both of the functions for the inputs that are provided at the beginning of the files (iteration.py and recursion.py)

(6) Create FIVE of your own test cases to test the correctness of your solution. While creating the test suit assume that the solution is provided by someone else and you have to find cases in which the solution would fail. Test your code and see if the solution works as expected. Remmeber graders will have their secret test suit to test your logic so avoid hardcoded solutions. 

(7) Once you are convinced that your solution would work, please do not forget to commit the changes and push the final version of code to the corresponding GitHub repository. Once pushed, you should login to your GitHub account, inspect the files that you have changed in order to make sure that the changes are saved in the GitHub repositories.
